## Notes
Write abstract for project proposal
Special process for ddsa but is good idea
not tiktok - Visual / video social media
Network dimension is interesting and limited in research
	
	Project proposal
	4 pages
	Methods - Data- Literature review



Problem: Video platforms and networks of videos
Angles: Polarization or Spread of Trends
	For now - 0.5 - 1 page explaininig what I want to do
	Start with problem
	Connect with video social media
	Video social media as networks
		Hard project but I am very smart - I have idea
	Provide ideas for how to do stuff
		Ex Create TikTok user graphs (duets, stitches, etc)
